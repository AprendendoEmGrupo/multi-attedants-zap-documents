## How to work Github project management task

- Backlog: in this column you all thing client(owner of project) request
- Todo: in this column you have all tasks necessaries to complete the backlog task.
- In progress: in this column you have all tasks the dev team your current.
- Validate PR's: in this column you have all tasks the dev team completed and open pull request to validate
- Done: in this column you have all tasks validated and completed. In this step all tasks are branch master.

### Rules

- Each developer can have one tasks in column **In progress**
- After completed task and open pull request you need to move task for column **Validate PR's**

## How to work with git in project

- Branch **master** code go to production
- Branch **staging** code go to staging. Warn: in future can have staging environment to validate if feature is ok before send production.
- Branch **Develop** all new feature created based this branch.

### Rules 

- To write commit message in english
- Never send your directly to branchs: **master**, **staging** and **develop**
- Always you complete your feature open pull request to branch **develop**
- When create branch for new feature you need use this pattern: feature/shor_description_about_task

### Example how to work: feature login

- Execute command: **git checkout develop**
- Execute command: **git pull origin develop**
- Execute command: **git checkout -b feature/login**
- Execute command when complete task or want send code to Github: **git push origin feature/login**
- Access Github 
- Open pull request to branch **develop**

## How to report error, some problem as your task or difficulty your task

- Send what's task you working
- Send error
- Send what your tried to resolve
